# Graph Visualizer – Graphs Algorithms using Java Swing

This project is an **interactive graph algorithms visualizer*, developed in **Java with Swing**.  
It allows users to manually create graphs, add edges with custom weights, and visualize classic algorithms such as **BFS**, **DFS**, and **Dijkstra** in real-time, with animations and path highlighting.

## Features

- ✅ Interactive graphical interface with Java Swing
- ✅ Add nodes with a click
- ✅ Connect nodes with edges and custom weights
- ✅ Animated visualization of algorithms:
    - **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**
    - **DFS (Depth-First Search)**
    - **Dijkstra (Shortest Path with weights)**
- ✅ Colors to represent states (visited, exploring, finished)
- ✅ Shortest path highlighted at the end of Dijkstra
- ✅ Side panel with control buttons
